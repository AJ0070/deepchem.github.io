  "text": "The DeepChem project aims to make high quality open source software for scientific machine learning more accessible to scientists and developers worldwide. We have a particular focus on molecular machine learning and drug discovery, but also support a broad range of applications in bioinformatics, materials science, and computational physics. I started DeepChem while doing my Ph.D. at Stanford, but today DeepChem operates as a global distributed community of researchers spread across many academic and industrial institutions. We hope that you will join our community and help us build!"
