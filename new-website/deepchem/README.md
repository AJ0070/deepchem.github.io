# Instructions

## Setting Up

- Install dependencies using `npm i` in the `/deepchem/` directory.

## Build

- Execute `npm run build`

## Project Config

### .babelrc

This is a Babel configuration file for a project using the "next/babel" preset and no additional plugins.

### .eslint.yml

This is a configuration file for ESLint, a tool that helps to maintain a consistent code style and catch potential errors in the JavaScript code.

- The `env` field specifies that this configuration should be applied in a browser environment and that it should support ECMAScript 2021 features.

- The `extends` field specifies that this configuration extends the `plugin:react/recommended` configuration for React, the `google` configuration, and the `prettier` configuration. This will enable linting rules for React, Google's JavaScript style guide, and Prettier, a code formatter.

- The `overrides` field is empty, meaning no additional rules are applied to specific files or directories.

- The `parserOptions` field specifies that this configuration should use the latest ECMAScript version and parse the source code as a module.

- The `plugins` field specifies that the `react` and `prettier` plugins should be used.

- The `rules` field specifies that the `prettier/prettier` rule should be set to `error`, which will cause ESLint to report any violations of the Prettier code format as errors. Additionally, the `react/react-in-jsx-scope` rule is turned off, the `require-jsdoc` rule is set to 0, and the `react/prop-types` rule is turned off. This means that ESLint will not report an error if the 'react' is not in the scope of JSX, it will not require JSDoc comments and it will not check for PropTypes.

### env-config.js
`env-config.js` sets up environment variables for the project.

### next-.config.js

`next-config.js` contains the configuration options for the project. Some things to note:

- The project has disabled the image optimization feature provided by Next.js. This is controlled by the `images.unoptimized` configuration option which is set to `true`. This setting is in place as the static export feature of Next.js is not compatible with the image optimization feature. In the context of this project, the impact of image optimization is considered minimal.
- Depending on the environment, the assetPrefix configuration option is conditionally set. This is implemented to ensure that the application functions correctly when hosted on Github Pages.

### package-lock.json

- `package-lock.json` is a file that is automatically generated by npm when you run `npm install`. It contains a detailed, versioned tree of all the dependencies and sub-dependencies in your project, as well as the versions of those dependencies that are currently installed.
  It is used to lock the dependencies versions, ensuring that they will not change unexpectedly, which could cause breakage in your application.
  The file is automatically updated every time you run `npm install` or `npm update`.

### postcss.config.js

- This is an autogenerated file, and needed for `tailwind` to work.
- No existing options have been changed and no additional options have been added.

### tailwind.config.js

This is a configuration file for the Tailwind CSS utility in the project. Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that you can use to style your HTML elements.

The configuration file sets various options for the project, such as:

- `content`: This array contains a list of file patterns that Tailwind should scan for class usage. In this case, it looks like the project is including all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the pages and components directories.

- `theme`: This object contains the configuration for various design theme related settings, such as font families, colors, and spacing.

- `fontFamily`: This object contains the configuration for various font families used in the project.

- `extend`: This object contains the configuration to add new CSS classes, such as custom color palettes.

- `plugins`: This array contains a list of additional Tailwind plugins that should be used in the project. This specific configuration is empty, meaning no additional plugins are being used.

This configuration file is used by Tailwind to generate the final CSS stylesheet for the project. This file should be kept and maintained to ensure the proper styling of the project.

### jsdoc.conf.json
The file `jsdoc.conf.json` is a configuration file for JSDoc, a JavaScript documentation generator, which allows for customization of various settings such as which tags and dictionaries to use, what files to include or exclude, what plugins to use, and where to output the generated documentation.

Following options have been used
- `tags.allowUnknownTags`: allows for the use of unknown tags in the documentation
- `tags.dictionaries`: specifies which dictionaries should be used, in this case `jsdoc` and `closure`
- `source.include`: specifies which directories should be included in the documentation generation
- `source.includePattern`: specifies a pattern for included file names
- `source.excludePattern`: specifies a pattern for excluded file names
- `plugins`: specifies which plugins should be used
- `templates.better-docs.name`: specifies the name for the `better-docs` template
- `templates.default.includeDate`: specifies whether the date should be included in the default template
- `opts.destination`: specifies the directory where the documentation should be generated
- `opts.recurse`: specifies whether the process should recurse through subdirectories
- `opts.readme`: specifies the main documentation file

### MathJax
The website uses MathJax to render the equations in the tutorials. Following configurations have been used and can be found in `layouts/tutorial.js` 

- equationNumbers: generates equation numbers using AMS style and label ids.
- tex2jax: converts TeX code to MathJax format, including inline and display math, escapes, and LaTeX environments.
- displayAlign: centers displayed equations.
- CommonHTML: uses the renderer for HTML output and enables automatic line breaking.

The specific options used are:

- autoNumber: "AMS", useLabelIds: true for equationNumbers
- inlineMath: [['$', '$']], displayMath: [['$$', '$$']], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true for tex2jax
- 'center' for displayAlign
- linebreaks: { automatic: true } for CommonHTML
